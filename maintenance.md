# Maintenance windows
{: #maintenance_window}

Routine maintenance windows are scheduled to ensure that your {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} system receives the latest features, patches, and upgrades. During these maintenance windows, updates are applied automatically without your intervention. For posts of maintenance windows, see [IBM Cloud status: Planned Maintenance](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?component=dashdb&selected=maintenance){: external}. We contact you directly if your system specifically needs maintenance.

If you have business situations or conditions that might be impacted by the scheduling of our maintenance windows, open a [support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/add){: external} to inform us about your concerns.
