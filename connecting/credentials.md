# Database details and connection credentials
{: #db_details_cxn_creds}

To configure your local development environment and to connect applications and tools to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database, you need to know the database details and connection credentials.
{: shortdesc}

## Database details
{: #db_details}

There are important database details that are needed for connecting applications and tools to your database:

- *Host name* - The host name of the server.
- *Port number* - Used by the database manager for TCP/IP communication. (Note that your service is provisioned with one port number for connections that use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and a different port for non-SSL connection.)

   If needed, you can get the IP address of your server by using the ping command or the nslookup command, specifying your host name.
- *Database name* - The Db2 database name, usually BLUDB.

## Connection credentials
{: #cxn_creds}

There are three types of credentials:

- *IBMid* - If you use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, this is the ID you would use to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. This is not what you use to connect applications or tools to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database.
- *Db2 database credentials* - Your service comes provisioned with a database user ID and password that can be used to connect applications and tools to your database.
- *Administrator-created users* - Some {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} plans allow administrative users to create new users. These administrator-created user IDs and passwords can be used to log directly into the web console URL and to connect to the Db2 database from applications or tools.

## Where to find database details and connection credentials
{: #location}

You can collect this information from the following places:

- *Your administrator* - If you are not the owner or administrator of your Db2 instance, you can get your database details and connect credentials from your administrator.
- *Db2 web console* - Database details and credentials are available in the web console.
- If you are using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}: 
   
   - *{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard* - When you view your service on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, in the "Service credentials" area, you can view the database details as well as the database user ID and password.
   - *`VCAP_SERVICES`* - `VCAP_SERVICES` is an environment variable in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} that contains database details and credentials in JSON format. When you view the service credentials for your service in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, the contents of `VCAP_SERVICES` is what is displayed. When you bind other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or apps to your service, those other services or apps can access database details and credentials programmatically by reading `VCAP_SERVICES`.
