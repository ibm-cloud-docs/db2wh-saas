# Dedicated private cloud for instances on Amazon Web Services
{: #AWS}

{{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} can now be deployed on an Amazon Web Services instance in a dedicated virtual network managed by IBM.  
{: shortdesc}

One quantity of this part supports up to ten {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} service instances. With a Dedicated Private Cloud, the virtual network is exclusively allocated to your IBM Db2 Warehouse SaaS instancesâ€”no other customer instances are provisioned within it.

If you'd like to request this option, open a support case with IBM Cloud support to make the request.  You will need to provide your IBM Cloud account ID in the ticket. 

The lead time required is approximately 3-4 weeks. After your dedicated private cloud environment has been pre-built, you can deploy one or more instances into the private cloud environment by setting "Dedicated Private Cloud Configuration" to Yes when you order the instance from the IBM Cloud catalog page.
