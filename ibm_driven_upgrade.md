 Instance on Db2 version 11.5 may be automatically upgraded to the next generation (Gen 3) of {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} during the scheduled maintenance window. This implicit upgrade ensures all environments are upgraded to Gen 3 and benefit from the latest enhancements with minimal manual intervention.


## What should I expect after the upgrade?

{: #q_after_auto_upgrade}

The implicit upgrade upgrades your system to the new generation of {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} and VPC Gen2 infrastructure, and also updates the database to the latest version automatically. This ensures that you immediately benefit from all new features introduced in the latest database version and no separate update action is required. Both [v4](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/db2-warehouse-on-cloud/db2-warehouse-on-cloud-v4) and [v5](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/db2-warehouse-on-cloud/db2-warehouse-on-cloud-v5) of the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} REST API will remain fully functional after the upgrade.

IBM Db2 Warehouse on Cloud Gen 3 now offers a Reserved Instance (RI) pricing model, enabling you to achieve significant savings on compute costs. By committing to a fixed term of either 1 year or 3 years, you can lower your expenses compared to the standard "On-Demand" pricing. This model is ideal for workloads with stable, long-term resource needs, providing both cost efficiency and predictable budgeting.

**How to Select a Reserved Instance Plan**

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud instance, click on it.
3. Click on **Go to UI**.
4. In the console screen, click on **Administration**.
5. Go to Settings/License, click on **Edit**.
6. From the available options, select the 1-year or 3-year RI plan that best fits your business needs.

The selected RI plan will automatically apply the discounted rate to your compute usage. You can see the updated pricing reflected in your billing dashboard.

If you encounter any issues during this process or need assistance in choosing the right plan, engage your IBM seller. Your sales representative is ready to provide guidance and ensure a smooth transition to the Reserved Instance pricing model.

After the upgrade, the Web Console URL will be updated. Please note the following changes:

- **Before Upgrade**  
    `https://<hostname>/console`

- **After Upgrade**  
    Follow these steps to open the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} web console:
    1. Navigate to the [IBM Cloud Resources list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).
    2. Under the **Databases** section, select your Db2 Warehouse database.
    3. Click the **Go to UI** button to launch the IBM Db2 Warehouse SaaS web console.

Please make sure to update any bookmarks, scripts, or integrations that rely on the console URL.

For most customers, you can resume working with your data as before. However, certain customers may encounter specific circumstances requiring further actions.   

*Private Connections from IBM Cloud VPC:* If you have workloads running on IBM Cloud VPC, you can leverage private connectivity (Private Link) to connect securely to your Db2 Warehouse instances using IBM Cloudâ€™s private network. Follow the steps outlined [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2whc?topic=Db2whc-connect_options#connecting-to-db2-warehouse-on-cloud-with-private-link).

To enable private connectivity:

   * First, enable private connectivity through the console.
   * Then, create a *Virtual Private Endpoint Gateway* on your VPC. The private endpoint and port will be provided in the Connections section of the console.

Private connectivity is a *regional service*, meaning that the Virtual Private Endpoint Gateway must be created in the same region as your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud instance.
{: note}

*VPN Connectivity:* If you currently connect via VPN, follow the instructions in the [VPN Connectivity guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2whc?topic=Db2whc-connect_options#vpn) to ensure proper setup after the upgrade.

## Storage Cost Optimization After Upgrade

{: #storagecost_optmz}

### Move Data from Block to Cloud Object Storage

{: #migr_move}

To start saving on storage costs, you will need to move eligble data from block storage to cloud object storage and then shrink the freed block storage. The limitations on what type of tables are eligible can be found within [this documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2w-as-a-service?topic=support-restrictions-limitations). There are two ways to move tables:

1. Via the service console, utilizing the Table Explorer, where a single table at a time can be moved to the pre-created cloud object storage tablespace.

2. Via a command line tool, which can automate bulk table moves and more. Details on how to install and use the tool can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/db2whmigratetocos).


### Shrink Block Storage

{: #migr_shrink}

After tables have been moved to cloud object storage, the block storage will need to be shrunk. The shrink operation can be performed as many times as required, however keep in mind that it is an offline operation and requires downtime. The shrink operation can be initiated via the service console as shown [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2whc?topic=Db2whc-scaling).
