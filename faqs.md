## Troubleshooting AWS‑specific issues

{: #q_awstroubleshooting}
{: faq}
{: support}

### Why are manual changes to workload monitoring settings not retained on Db2 Warehouse on Cloud instances hosted on AWS?

On Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service instances hosted on AWS, manual changes to workload monitoring settings are not retained. For example, disabling activity data collection for a workload such as `GGATE` using:

`ALTER WORKLOAD "GGATE" COLLECT ACTIVITY DATA NONE;`

The setting is periodically overwritten (every 10 minutes or based on the configured collection interval).

#### Cause

This behaviour occurs due to recurring configuration resets when the **Activity Event Monitor (RTMON_EVMON_ACTIVITIES)** is enabled in AWS-hosted environments.

#### Workaround

To maintain selective disabling of activity data collection while keeping overall monitoring active:

1. Create a stored procedure to check and update the workload’s activity data collection setting.
2. Schedule an admin task to execute the procedure every minute.

This ensures the desired workload setting is reapplied automatically.

### Notes

- This issue is specific to Db2 Warehouse on Cloud instances hosted on AWS.  
- If you encounter similar behaviour, apply the workaround above.  
- Contact IBM Support if the problem persists.
